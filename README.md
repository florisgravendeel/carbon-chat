# Carbon Chat
> A WebSockets Chat system implementation using the [Carbon Language](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) and C++.

## Running the program
I recommend to download to one of the releases. It's the quickest way run to the project.

## Prerequisite for development
- C++
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Boost 1.81.0](https://www.boost.org/users/download/)
    - On Windows Boost should be installed in `C:/local/boost_1_81_0` (Default Installation Folder)
    - On Mac, run `brew install boost` (Note: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) required)
- Carbon is required. See the install guide [here](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang#getting-started).
  - Optional: Use [this extension](https://github.com/rishaandesai/CarbonVSCode.git) to enable syntax highlighting in Carbon.
